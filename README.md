Irc Bot for IRC2P in Perl


Need to add things in the readme. You need to install mysql-server

# apt-get install mysql-server

Set your root password to the same root password for mysql set in mysql.pm

You need to create database called: "urldatabase"
# Will add the command to do that here later.

You need to create table called: "urls".
# Will add the command to do that here later. 

I should try find a way to automate the installation of dependencies 
and creation of database and table.
