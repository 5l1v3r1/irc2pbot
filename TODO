Need some focus.


Remove web application part for now. Can add that later. Instead make users be able to retrieve urls with some command.
Then they can be retrieved from mysql database.

Catch errors.

Write unit tests. See on cpan what I should use for this.



Write some code to check if i2p and tor are running.
